                  I've been looking t omake a transition and have heard some
                  people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the
                  free intro crouse and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
                  shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most
                  grueling - time of my life. Since completing the crouse, I've
                  successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer

                "Before joining the bootcamp. I've never written a line of code.
                I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
                programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
                program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
                They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
                assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
                outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that
                no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it
                during interviews as an example of my development experience. It
                certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after
                receiving multiple offesr. 100% recommended!"
